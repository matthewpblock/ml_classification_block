# Peer Review of Midterm Project of HeartDisease_Chastain.ipynb
 The peer review must contain a clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review. Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback. Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well. Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.

## Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
The notebook does a good job of following the assigned header structure. The flow could have been more clear with some additional narrative description to help transition between sections. I would have liked to read more about why Megan made the choices she did throughout the project and how the results could help inform decision making.

## Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
I think the feature selection largely made sense, but more explanation on the reasoning and justification would have been helpful in following the project.

## Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
I think this was the clearest part of the project notebook (which is good!). I wasn't left with any questions as to which model performed better.

## Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
The insights that were shared are good. I would have liked to see a bit more here though. The reasoning behind feature and model selection seems like it was probably solid behind the scenes. Putting more of that reasoning on the page would add extra relatability for your audience.
- Explain why you chose the model types you did.
- Explain why you chose the features for X that you did.
- Explain why you chose the feature for y that you did. What is the value of predicting this particular data point?
- Give examples of how someone could use your model results to help inform decision making.

## Conclusion
Megan said she had a lot of uncertainty on which plots and graphs to use, and got assistance in selecting from Gemini. I do the same frequently. One tip I've found is that I can you get better suggestions on the second ask. If I just ask for general plot type suggestions for a given issue, I can look at the results of its first suggestion and usually think of some ways the visualization would be more helpful if it were displayed differently. I then follow up with some suggested improvements and get a better refined suggestion. This process also helps me have a good description for which I chose the specific visualization I did.
Great job on your modeling work, Megan. Keep up the good work!
